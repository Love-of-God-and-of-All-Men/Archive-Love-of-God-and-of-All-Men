## What I've learned this month:

### Faith
Faith requires action. The prophet Lehi in the Book of Mormon showed how to have active faith. Lehi went to teach the people of Jerusalem and as he did he "prayed unto the Lord...with all of his heart on behalf of his people." ([1 Nephi 1:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p5#p5){:target="_blank"})

Part of faith is looking for things you are thankful for even in the midst of difficult circumstances, not complaining. ([1 Nephi 3:6 (4-7)](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p6#p4){:target="_blank"})

### Promised Blessings
Blessings are conditional on keeping God's commandments, but when kept blessings always come. ([1 Nephi 2:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p20#p20){:target="_blank"})
