I know that God hears and _answers_ your prayers. Some days you try your best and it feels small in comparison to others or even your other efforts. God does see and know you are doing your best day to day.
He wants to hear you. Reach out to Him. For those who have been praying, and may not have received an answer yet, "the Lord hath heard thy prayers, and hath judged of thy righteousness, [and] thou mayest rejoice." [(Mosiah 3:4)](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3?id=p4&lang=eng#p4){:target="_blank"}

I promise He is there.
