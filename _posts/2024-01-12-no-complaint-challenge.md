## My Challenge
Recently, I participated in a challenge for one day where for the whole day, I tried not to complain. Not only that, but I tried looking for things to be grateful for instead.

It was a great exercise. Taking a whole day and not complaining was more challenging than I expected. It was great mental exercise and taught me I had something I could change.

## My Challenge to You
I challenge you to go a day without complaining. See what happens. Write down your thoughts. After a while, this practice will help you be happier and make it easier to see what blessings you have in your life.

This challenge was inspired by a scripture in the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ. Read it here:
