## What I've learned this week:

### Faith
Faith requires action. The prophet Lehi in the Book of Mormon showed how to have active faith. Lehi went to teach the people of Jerusalem and as he did he "prayed unto the Lord...with all of his heart on behalf of his people." (1 Nephi 1:5, See also James 2:17)

### Blessings
Blessings are conditional on keeping God's commandments, but when kept blessings always come. (1 Nephi 2:20)
